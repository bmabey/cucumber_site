        Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text.
        The text is written in a
        <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html">business-readable domain-specific language</a>
        and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cucumber works with Ruby, Java, .NET, Flex or web applications written in any language.
        It has been translated to over 20 spoken languages.
      </p>

      <p>Cucumber also supports more succinct tests in tables - similar to what <a href="http://fit.c2.com/"><span class="caps">FIT</span></a> does. Dig around in the examples and documentation to learn more about Cucumber tables.</p>

      <h2>Background and Credits</h2>

      <p>Cucumber is Aslak Hellesøy&#8217;s rewrite of RSpec&#8217;s &#8220;Story runner&#8221;, which was originally written by Dan North. (Which again was a rewrite of his first implementation - &#8220;RBehave&#8221;). Early versions of &#8220;Story runner&#8221;
      required that stories be written in Ruby. Shortly after, David Chelimsky added
      <a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/10/21/story-runner-in-plain-english">plain text</a> support with
      contributions from half a dozen other people.</p>

      <p>
        Aslak Hellesøy wrote Cucumber to address the usability problems of the RSpec Story Runner. <a href="http://blog.josephwilk.net/">Joseph Wilk</a> joined as a regular contributor when Cucumber was just a little Gherkin,
        and over <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/cucumber/factoids/1022583">over 40</a> developers have contributed
        patches and bugfixes.
      </p>

      <p>The meta-language that Cucumber uses is based on several conversations and blog posts
      by <a href="http://dannorth.net/">Dan North</a>, <a href="http://abc.truemesh.com/">Chris Matts</a>,
      <a href="http://sirenian.livejournal.com/">Liz Keogh</a>, <a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/">David Chelimsky</a> and dozens of people on the RSpec mailing list.

          <p>We are currently rolling out Cucumber to all projects within <span class="caps">BBC</span> Worldwide.

          <p>I finally looked into cucumber last week and immediately loved it.  Within a couple hours I had several features written for an existing application. By the end of the next day, our whole team was writing cucumber features, and enjoying it!  Cucumber seems to have brought back an excitement to testing that I haven&#8217;t felt for a while (since my first few weeks with RSpec).</p>
